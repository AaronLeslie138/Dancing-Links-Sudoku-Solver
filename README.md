# Dancing-Links-Sudoku-Solver

This was done as part of a bonus competition in my Artificial Intelligence Course.

It converts sudoku puzzles of n^2 size to Exact Cover problems, and then solves them efficiently with Donald Knuth's Dancing Links algorithm.

It performs reasonably well on 36x36 sudoku puzzles.

I removed the functions to load boards and such from the Board class, as the original Board class was completed as part of the assignment and I do not wish to aid cheating.

The actual algorithm implementations are all my own.
